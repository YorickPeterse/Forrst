# Forrst

**IMPORTANT:** this library is still in the early stages of development. More details will
be added once it reaches a stable version.

forrst is a Ruby library for the [Forrst][forrst] API. This implementation aims to become
an implementation that focuses on ease of use, minimal amount of dependencies and
stability. I'm also aiming for support of all Ruby distributions such as JRuby and MRI.
